        <p>
            Monkeypox (MPX) is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs mostly in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa
            but can spread to other regions. Zoonotic diseases can spread between animals and humans.
            The monkeypox virus is part of the same family of viruses as variola virus which causes smallpox. It is a
            rare viral illness that can become serious. For most people, symptoms will clear up on their own after 2 to
            4 weeks.
            <br>
            Since May 2022, there has been a global increase in MPX infections in multiple countries where the illness
            is not usually seen. MPX was first reported in Australia May 2022.
            <br>
            On 28 July 2022, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer declared monkeypox to be a Communicable Disease Incident
            of National Significance. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the MPX outbreak a public health
            emergency of international concern on 23 July 2022.

            <h2> Old Monkeys vs New Monkeys</h2>
        </font>
        <img src="oldnew.png" width=400>

        <p>
            Monkeys are arranged into two main groups: Old World and New World. Old World monkeys all belong to one
            family,
            Cercopithecidae, which is related to apes and humans, and together they are classified as catarrhines
            (meaning
            “downward-nosed” in Latin). The New World monkeys are the platyrrhines (“flat-nosed”), a group comprising
            five
            families. As their taxonomic names suggest, New World (platyrrhine) and Old World (catarrhine) monkeys are
            distinguished by the form of the nose. New World monkeys have broad noses with a wide septum separating
            outwardly directed nostrils, whereas Old World monkeys have narrow noses with a thin septum and
            downward-facing
            nostrils, as do apes and humans. Old World monkeys have hard, bare “sitting pads” (ischial callosities) on
            the
            buttocks; New World monkeys lack these. Many Old World monkeys have thumbs that can be opposed to the other
            fingers and so can handle small objects precisely. None of the New World monkeys has such manual dexterity.
            Indeed, in the hands of many species, the main divergence is between the index and middle fingers; in a few
            species, the thumb is reduced or even absent. Some New World monkey species have prehensile tails capable of
            supporting the entire body weight or of grasping, for example, a proffered peanut. No Old World monkeys have
            this ability, and macaques are nearly tailless.
