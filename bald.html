        The bald uakari (Cacajao calvus) or bald-headed uakari is a small New World monkey characterized by a very short
        tail; bright, crimson face; a bald head; and long coat.[4] The bald uakari is restricted to v√°rzea forests and
        other wooded habitats near water in the western Amazon of Brazil and Peru.[2]. The bald uakari weighs between
        2.75 and 3.45 kg (6.1 and 7.6 lb), with head and body lengths average 45.6 cm (18.0 in) (male) and 44.0 cm (17.3
        in) (female).[5] In general, the bald uakari has a long, shaggy coat ranging from white in color to red and its
        head is bald.[4] The tail is bob-like and rather short for a New World monkey (about 5.9 in (15 cm)), at only
        half the length of the body and head combined.[6] Its scarlet red face is due to the lack of skin pigments and
        plentiful capillaries that run under its facial tissue.[4]
